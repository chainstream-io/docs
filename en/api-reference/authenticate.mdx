## Signing Requests

ChainStream uses API keys to authenticate all API calls. The **Base API URL** will be one of the following depending on your workspace environment type:

* Sandbox: `https://sandbox-api.chainstream.io/v1`
* Mainnet/Testnet: `https://api.chainstream.io/v1`

Each API request must include the following headers:

* `X-API-Key` - API key created from your ChainStream workspace.
* `Authorization` - This value should be set to `Bearer <Access Token>`. The access token is a Base64 encoded JSON Web Token (JWT).

## JWT Structure

`Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`

The JWT payload should contain the following fields:

* `uri` - The URI portion of the request (e.g., /v1/transactions)
* `nonce` - A unique number or string. Each API request must have a different nonce
* `iat` - The time at which the JWT was issued, in Epoch seconds
* `exp` - The time after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing, in Epoch seconds (must be less than `iat`+30 seconds)
* `sub` - API key
* `bodyHash` - A hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the raw HTTP request body

The JWT must be signed using your ChainStream API key and the RS256 algorithm (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256 hash).

## Using SDKs

You can use the ChainStream SDK to set up request headers, as shown in these examples:

### JavaScript SDK

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import { ChainStreamSDK } from "chainstream-sdk";

const apiSecret = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "./chainstream_secret.key"), "utf8");
const apiKey = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX";
const chainstream = new ChainStreamSDK(apiSecret, apiKey);
```

### Python SDK

```python
from chainstream_sdk import ChainStreamSDK

apiSecret = open('chainstream_secret.key', 'r').read()
apiKey = 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'
chainstream = ChainStreamSDK(apiSecret, apiKey)
```

<Note>
When using the SDK code examples above to sign requests, make sure to replace `apiKey` with your own API key.
