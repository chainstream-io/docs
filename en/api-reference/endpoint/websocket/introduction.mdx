## Overview

WebSocket endpoints are available for real-time data streaming and as an alternative to HTTP request sending on the ChainStream exchange. The WebSocket URLs by network are:

* Mainnet: `wss://realtime-dex.chainstream.io/connection/websocket`

## Authentication

WebSocket connections require authentication via request headers. You must include the `Authorization` header with the format `Bearer <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>`.

<Note>
If you are using our **Go SDK** or **JavaScript SDK**, authentication is built-in and handled automatically. You only need to manually set the authorization header when using native WebSocket libraries.
</Note>

## Connecting

To connect to the WebSocket API, you must establish a WebSocket connection to the respective URL based on your desired network, with authentication information in the request headers. Once connected, you can start sending subscription messages to receive real-time data updates.

### Command Line Example

Using `wscat` to test the connection (requires Authorization header):

```bash
$ wscat -c wss://realtime-dex.chainstream.io/connection/websocket \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> { "method": "subscribe", "subscription": { "type": "trades", "coin": "SOL" } }
< {"channel":"subscriptionResponse","data":{"method":"subscribe","subscription":{"type":"trades","coin":"SOL"}}}
```

<Warning>
Failing to provide a valid `Authorization` header will result in connection rejection or inability to receive data.
</Warning>

<Note>
This documentation uses TypeScript for defining message types. For Python users, you can find equivalent types in our Python SDK.
