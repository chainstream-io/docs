## Prompt Best Practices

### Specify the Chain

```
✅ Good: Query balance of 0x... on Ethereum
❌ Bad: Query balance of 0x...
```

### Provide Full Address

```
✅ Good: Analyze 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
❌ Bad: Analyze 0x1234...5678
```

### Specify Time Range

```
✅ Good: View trade records from the past 7 days
❌ Bad: View recent trades
```

### Break Down Complex Tasks

Split complex tasks into simpler questions:

```
✅ Good:
1. First query this address's holdings
2. Then analyze its trade history
3. Finally determine its investment style

❌ Bad:
Tell me everything about this address
```

### Use Context for Follow-ups

```
User: Query holdings of 0x...
AI: [Returns holdings list]
User: Which of these tokens has the highest gain?
User: Analyze reasons for holding PEPE
```
