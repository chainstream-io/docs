### Pricing
Welcome to the Chainstream Data Services pricing guide. This section outlines our transparent and scalable pricing structure designed to support developers, startups, and enterprise-grade applications.

#### Summary

| Plan | Base Price (A) | Included Credits (B) | Data Access | Cost per 50K Additional Credits (F) |
|------|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------------------------:|

<Note>

</Note>

#### Total Cost Calculation
To calculate your monthly cost, use the following formula:

```text
Total Cost = Base Price + Additional Credits Ã— Overage Price
```

Or more precisely:

```text
Cost(X) = A(X) + [(T(X) - B(X)) / 1,000,000] Ã— F(X)
```

Where:
- X = Plan Type
- T(X) = Total number of credits consumed in the month
- A(X) = Base price for package X
- B(X) = Number of credits included in package X
- F(X) = Cost per 1M additional credits in package X
