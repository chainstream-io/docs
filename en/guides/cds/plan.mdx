<Note>

</Note>

#### Total Cost Calculation
To calculate your monthly cost, use the following formula:

```text
Total Cost = Base Price + Additional Credits Ã— Overage Price
```

Or more precisely:

```text
Cost(X) = A(X) + [(T(X) - B(X)) / 1,000,000] Ã— F(X)
```

Where:
- X = Plan type
- A(X) = Base price of Plan X
- B(X) = Included compute units in Plan X
- T(X) = Total compute units used in the month
- F(X) = Overage cost per 1 million compute units in Plan X
