## What is KYT

**KYT (Know Your Transaction)** is a risk identification mechanism for individual cryptocurrency transactions, providing real-time analysis of each on-chain transaction to determine its risk level and provide handling recommendations.

<Info>
**Core Question**: Is this transaction safe?

KYT helps you quickly identify the risk level and associated risk entities before processing each transaction.
</Info>

## Comparison with Traditional Finance

| Dimension | Traditional Finance | Crypto KYT |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Monitoring Method** | Bank transaction monitoring | On-chain transaction analysis |
| **Data Foundation** | Account history based | Address association based |
| **Processing Time** | T+1 batch processing | Real-time/near real-time |
| **Rule Engine** | Primarily manual rules | Algorithm + label driven |

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph input [Input]
        tx[Transaction Hash/Details]
    end
    
    subgraph analysis [Analysis Engine]
        trace[Fund Tracing]
        entity[Entity Identification]
        pattern[Pattern Detection]
        sanction[Sanctions Screening]
    end
    
    subgraph output [Output]
        score[Risk Score]
        exposure[Risk Exposure]
        alerts[Alerts]
        action[Recommendations]
    end
    
    input --> analysis
    analysis --> output
```

### Analysis Flow

1. **Fund Tracing**: Trace fund sources and destinations forward/backward
2. **Entity Identification**: Identify known entities involved in transactions (exchanges, protocols, labeled addresses)
3. **Pattern Detection**: Identify suspicious transaction patterns (splitting, obfuscation, layering)
4. **Sanctions Screening**: Match against sanctions lists

## Risk Level Definitions

ChainStream uses a four-tier risk classification system:

| Level | Indicator | Definition | Typical Triggers |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **SEVERE** | 🔴 | Known criminal association | Sanctioned addresses, confirmed hacker addresses, darknet markets |
| **HIGH** | 🟠 | High-risk patterns | Mixer outputs, scam associations, unlicensed gambling |
| **MEDIUM** | 🟡 | Requires attention | High-risk exchanges, privacy coin swaps, anomalous patterns |
| **LOW** | 🟢 | Normal | Known compliant entities, regular user behavior |

### Level Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SEVERE" icon="circle-exclamation">
    - **Definition**: Direct association with confirmed criminal activity
    - **Data Sources**: OFAC sanctions list, law enforcement reports, confirmed hacking incidents
    - **False Positive Rate**: Very low (&lt;0.1%)
    - **Recommended Action**: Immediate freeze, report to regulators
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="HIGH" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    - **Definition**: High-risk characteristics but unconfirmed criminal activity
    - **Data Sources**: Mixer identification, scam address clustering, behavior pattern analysis
    - **False Positive Rate**: Low (&lt;5%)
    - **Recommended Action**: Manual review, delayed processing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="MEDIUM" icon="circle-info">
    - **Definition**: Risk signals present but requires further evaluation
    - **Data Sources**: Association analysis, behavioral anomaly detection
    - **False Positive Rate**: Moderate (5-15%)
    - **Recommended Action**: Enhanced monitoring, may proceed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="LOW" icon="circle-check">
    - **Definition**: No obvious risk characteristics
    - **Data Sources**: Normal transaction patterns, known compliant entities
    - **Recommended Action**: Process normally
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recommended Action Mapping

Based on risk level, the system provides standardized action recommendations:

| Risk Level | Recommended Action | Automation Level | SLA |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|-----|
| **SEVERE** | Freeze | Automatic | Immediate |
| **HIGH** | Manual Review | Requires manual confirmation | 4 hours |
| **MEDIUM** | Enhanced Monitoring | Semi-automatic | 24 hours |
| **LOW** | Pass | Automatic | Immediate |

### Action Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    input[Transaction Input] --> analysis[KYT Analysis]
    analysis --> severe{SEVERE?}
    severe -->|Yes| freeze[Freeze + SAR Report]
    severe -->|No| high{HIGH/MEDIUM?}

## Exposure Types

ChainStream distinguishes between two types of risk exposure:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Exposure">
    **Definition**: Transaction directly interacts with a risk address
    
    ```
    Risk Address ──────────────> Target Address
                 Direct Transfer
                 
    Exposure Type: DIRECT
    Risk Transmission: 100%
    ```
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - One-hop association
    - High certainty of risk
    - Typically triggers immediate response
    
    **Example Scenarios**:
    - Receiving funds from known hacker address
    - Sending to sanctioned address
    - Receiving directly from mixer output
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "DIRECT",
      "category": "SANCTIONS",
      "entity": "OFAC Sanctioned Address",
      "percentage": 100
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Indirect Exposure">
    **Definition**: Associated with risk address through N hops
    
    ```
    Risk Address ──> Intermediate1 ──> Intermediate2 ──> Target Address
                 N-hop Association
                 
    Exposure Type: INDIRECT
    Risk Transmission: Decay calculation
    ```
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - Multi-hop association (typically 2-5 hops)
    - Risk decays with distance
    - Requires comprehensive evaluation
    
    **Decay Model**:
    
    `Risk Score = Base Risk × (Decay Factor ^ Hops)`
    
    Example: Base risk 100, decay factor 0.5, after 3 hops = 100 × 0.5³ = 12.5
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "INDIRECT",
      "category": "MIXER",
      "entity": "Tornado Cash",
      "percentage": 12.5,
      "hops": 3
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Exposure Handling Guidelines

| Scenario | Direct Handling | Indirect Handling |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| SEVERE source | Immediate freeze | Freeze within 2 hops, 3+ hops manual review |
| HIGH source | Manual review | Flag for monitoring |
| MEDIUM source | Process normally | Ignore |

    2. Regularly analyze false positive patterns
    3. Submit false positive feedback to ChainStream
    4. Adjust local threshold configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audit Trail" icon="file-lines">
    Ensure compliance audit requirements:
    
    - Save all KYT requests and responses
