## Identification Methodology

### Data Sources

ChainStream analyzes the following on-chain data:

- All DEX trading records
- Token holding changes
- Fund flow trajectories
- Trading time distribution
- Gas fee patterns

### Candidate Pool Selection Method

ChainStream uses a reverse-tracking method based on new launch token performance to build the Smart Money candidate pool:

#### Selection Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Token Performance Screening">
    From all newly launched tokens in the past 60 days, select the top 1000 best-performing tokens based on market cap growth/trading volume metrics
  </Step>
  <Step title="Early Participant Identification">
    For the above tokens, identify addresses that bought in the early stage (within 24 hours after launch)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address De-noising">
    Exclude the following address types:
    - DEV/project addresses (identified by trading patterns)
    - Market maker addresses (identified by high-frequency wash trading)
    - CEX hot wallet addresses (matched against known address database)
    - Sybil attack addresses (identified by correlation analysis)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Frequency Statistics and Ranking">
    Count each address's early buy frequency in the top 1000 tokens, take the top 200 addresses with highest frequency as the Smart Money candidate pool
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Dynamic Rolling Update Mechanism

To maintain timeliness and accuracy of Smart Money data, ChainStream implements a weekly rolling update with weight decay:

| Configuration | Value |
|:--|:--|
| Update Cycle | Every Monday UTC 00:00 |
| Window Size | 60 days (approximately 8 weeks) |
| Rolling Method | Remove oldest week's data weekly, include latest week's data |

#### Weight Decay Model

| Data Period | Weight |
|:--|:--|
| Last 1 week | 100% |
| 2 weeks ago | 85% |
| 3 weeks ago | 70% |
| 4 weeks ago | 55% |
| 5-8 weeks ago | 40% |

<Warning>
Rolling updates mean the Smart Money list changes dynamically. Historical Smart Money addresses with poor recent performance will gradually be removed from the candidate pool.
</Warning>

## Data Update Cycle

### Real-time Updates

| Data Type | Update Latency |
|:--|:--|
| New trade detection | &lt; 1 minute |
| Position changes | &lt; 5 minutes |

### Periodic Updates

| Data Type | Update Cycle |
|:--|:--|
| Smart Money list | Every Monday UTC 00:00 |
| Score recalculation | Every 24 hours |
| Full re-evaluation | Every 30 days |

## Usage Guidelines

<Warning>
Smart Money signals are for reference only and do not constitute investment advice.
</Warning>

### Correct Usage

- Use as a research starting point to discover tokens worth attention
- Combine with fundamental analysis to make independent judgments
- Understand signal latency — on-chain transactions need confirmation time
- Focus on multiple signal convergence to improve accuracy

### Incorrect Usage

- Blindly copy trading without any research
- Ignore trading costs (Gas, slippage)
- Ignore market environment and macro factors
- Over-rely on a single signal source

---

## Limitations

### 1. Information Delay

    A[SM discovers opportunity] --> B[SM on-chain trade]
    B --> C[Block confirmation]
    C --> D[ChainStream detection]
    D --> E[You receive signal]
    
    C -.->|3-30 second delay| E
```

### 2. Counter-trading Risk

- Some SM may realize they're being tracked and deliberately counter-trade
- Large buys may be creating false signals for dumping

### 3. Market Capacity Limits

- Following SM buys will push up prices
- Small market cap tokens have limited capacity, copy trading effectiveness diminishes

### 4. Past Performance Doesn't Guarantee Future Results

- Historical high returns don't guarantee future performance
- Market environment changes may cause strategies to fail
