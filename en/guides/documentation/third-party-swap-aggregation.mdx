## Third-party Swap Aggregation

<Note>
Chainstream integrates with trusted decentralized exchanges (DEXs), enabling users to seamlessly swap cryptocurrencies directly within the Chainstream platform. Currently, Chainstream leverages Jupiter Protocol, a leading decentralized exchange aggregator.
</Note>

### Integration with Jupiter

<Card title="Protocol Integration">
Chainstream's swap functionality is powered by Jupiter's decentralized exchange aggregation protocol. All swap transactions initiated within Chainstream are executed directly on Jupiter's decentralized infrastructure, ensuring secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant trading.
</Card>

### Decentralized Swaps

<Warning>
Chainstream does not process swaps directly. All swap transactions occur on-chain through Jupiter's decentralized exchange, ensuring completely trustless execution without third-party interference.
</Warning>

### No Additional Processing Fee

<Card title="Fee Structure">
Chainstream does NOT charge any additional processing fees for swap transactions. Users only pay standard blockchain transaction fees determined by the decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols. Chainstream solely charges fees related to data services, maintaining transparency and fairness for our users.
</Card>

### Disclaimer

<Warning>
Chainstream is not responsible for lost funds resulting from swaps involving unreliable tokens or user errors. Additionally, Chainstream has no control over the execution of swaps, as these occur entirely on-chain through Jupiter Protocol. Users must perform their own due diligence and exercise caution before initiating swaps.
</Warning>

### How to Swap

<Card title="Step-by-Step Guide">
1. Navigate to the Swap section within Chainstream.
2. Select the cryptocurrencies you wish to exchange.
3. Enter the desired amounts clearly.
4. Confirm transaction details and approve the swap.
5. Swaps are executed directly via Jupiter Protocol, with the resulting assets delivered straight to your connected wallet.
</Card>

### Important Considerations

<Card title="Key Points to Remember">
- Ensure your wallet has sufficient funds to cover the blockchain transaction fees.
- Always double-check swap details (token symbols, amounts, receiving wallet address) before final confirmation.
- Swaps are irreversible once confirmed; exercise caution during the confirmation process.
