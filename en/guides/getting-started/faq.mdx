## Technical Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do I do about 429 or 403 errors?">
    - **429 error**: Request rate exceeded
    - **403 error**: Quota exhausted

    **Troubleshooting:**

    1. **429 - Check if rate limited**
       - Free plan: 10 requests/minute
       - Paid plans: See [API Security](/en/guides/data-concepts/api-security)

    2. **403 - Check if quota exhausted**
       - View remaining quota in Dashboard → Usage
       - Paid plans can purchase additional quota to restore service

    **Solutions:**
    - 429: Implement request throttling or exponential backoff retry
    - 403: Purchase additional quota or upgrade plan
    - Use WebSocket instead of polling to reduce request count

```javascript
// Error handling example
async function handleApiError(error) {
  if (error.status === 429) {
    // Rate limited, wait and retry
    await sleep(1000);
    return retry();
  } else if (error.status === 403) {
    // Quota exhausted, need to purchase additional quota
    console.error('Quota exhausted, please purchase additional quota in Dashboard');
  }
}
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle WebSocket disconnections?">
    Implement an auto-reconnect mechanism:

```javascript
class ChainStreamWebSocket {
  constructor(baseUrl, accessToken) {
    this.baseUrl = baseUrl;
    this.accessToken = accessToken;
    this.reconnectDelay = 1000;
    this.maxReconnectDelay = 30000;
    this.connect();
  }

  connect() {
    // Pass token via URL parameter
    const url = `${this.baseUrl}?token=${this.accessToken}`;
    this.ws = new WebSocket(url);
    this.ws.onopen = () => {
      console.log('Connected');
      this.reconnectDelay = 1000; // Reset delay
    };
    this.ws.onclose = () => {
      console.log('Disconnected, reconnecting...');
      setTimeout(() => this.connect(), this.reconnectDelay);
      // Exponential backoff
      this.reconnectDelay = Math.min(
        this.reconnectDelay * 2,
        this.maxReconnectDelay
      );
    };
    this.ws.onerror = (error) => {
      console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    };
  }
}
```

    **Reconnection tips:**
    - Use exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 30s)
    - Set maximum reconnect delay (e.g., 30 seconds)
    - Re-subscribe to data after successful reconnection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the API response format?">
    All APIs return JSON format.

    **Success response:**

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "address": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
  "name": "Wrapped SOL",
  "symbol": "SOL",
  "decimals": 9,
  "price": 95.42
}
```

    **Error response:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_TOKEN",
    "message": "Token not found"
  }
}
```

    See [Error Codes](/en/guides/resources/error-codes) for common error codes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I debug API requests?">
    **Method 1: Use API Playground**

    Use the "Try It" feature on [API Reference](/en/api-reference) pages to test without writing code.

    **Method 2: Use cURL**

    Add `-v` flag for detailed request info:

```bash
curl -v "https://api.chainstream.io/v1/token/{chain}/{address}/metadata" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## KYT/KYA Related

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between KYT and KYA?">
    | Feature | KYA (Address Verification) | KYT Report |
    |:--|:--|:--|

    | Input | Wallet address | Transaction hash or address |
    | Output | Risk level + address type + risk exposures | Transaction-related risk analysis |
    | Typical use case | Address screening before user registration/deposit | Compliance check for specific transactions |

    See [Security Compliance docs](/en/guides/security-compliance/overview).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What information does Address Verification return?">
    Address verification returns these fields:

    | Field | Description | Example Values |
    |:--|:--|:--|
    | Risk | Risk level | Low, Medium, High, Severe |
    | Status | Verification status | COMPLETE, PENDING |
    | Address Type | Address type | PRIVATE_WALLET, EXCHANGE, CONTRACT, etc. |
    | Risk Exposures | Risk exposure details | Risk labels and associated amounts |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I interpret risk levels?">
    Address Verification returns these risk levels:

    | Risk Level | Meaning | Recommended Action |
    |:--|:--|:--|
    | Low | Low risk, no obvious suspicious associations | Process normally |
    | Medium | Medium risk, some suspicious associations | Manual review recommended |
    | High | High risk, significant suspicious associations | Reject or enhanced review recommended |
    | Severe | Severe risk, direct association with sanctioned/illegal entities | Strongly recommend rejection |

    **Note:** Specific handling policies should be based on your business compliance requirements. Above are reference suggestions only.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What risk labels are in Risk Exposures?">
    Risk Exposures shows address associations with various risk entities. Common labels include:

    **High-risk labels (Severe):**

    | Label | Description |
    |:--|:--|
    | sanctioned entity | Associated with sanctioned entity |
    | sanctioned jurisdiction | Associated with sanctioned jurisdiction |
    | terrorist financing | Associated with terrorist financing |

    **Neutral/low-risk labels:**

    | Label | Description |
    |:--|:--|
    | bridge | Funds transferred via cross-chain bridge |
    | decentralized exchange | Traded via DEX |
    | atm | Traded via crypto ATM |

    **Other risk labels:**

    | Label | Description |
    |:--|:--|
    | mixer | Via mixing service |
    | gambling | Associated with gambling platform |
    | darknet | Associated with darknet market |

    Each label shows:
    - **direct / indirect**: Direct or indirect association
    - **amount**: Associated fund amount
    - **percentage**: Percentage of total transaction volume
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between direct and indirect?">
    | Type | Meaning | Risk Level |
    |:--|:--|:--|
    | direct | Address directly interacted with risk entity | Higher |
    | indirect | Address indirectly associated via intermediate addresses | Relatively lower |

    **Examples:**
    - `sanctioned entity + direct`: Address directly transferred to sanctioned address
    - `sanctioned entity + indirect`: Associated address of this address previously interacted with sanctioned address

    Even indirect associations warrant careful handling if involving Severe-level labels (sanctions, terrorist financing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Address Types are there?">
    | Address Type | Description |
    |:--|:--|
    | PRIVATE_WALLET | Personal wallet address |

## AI/MCP Related

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MCP?">
    MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol proposed by Anthropic that enables AI models to call external tools.

    ChainStream provides an MCP Server that lets Claude and other AIs directly query on-chain data.

    See [MCP Server docs](/en/guides/ai-infrastructure/mcp-server/introduction).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I use ChainStream in Claude Desktop?">
    1. Install ChainStream MCP Server
    2. Configure Claude Desktop's MCP settings
    3. Restart Claude Desktop
    4. Start chatting - Claude can automatically call ChainStream to query data

    See [Claude Integration guide](/en/guides/ai-infrastructure/mcp-server/setup-guide) for detailed setup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can AI execute transactions?">
    **Not currently supported.** ChainStream MCP Server only provides read operations:

    - Query token prices and information
    - Query wallet holdings and transaction history
    - Execute KYT/KYA risk assessments

    Does not support automatic transaction execution, transfers, or other write operations for security reasons.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are MCP calls billed?">
    MCP calls are billed the same as direct API calls, consuming Units based on the actual API type called.
  </Accordion>
