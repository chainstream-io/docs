## What is ChainStream

ChainStream is AI-Native infrastructure built for the Web3 era. Unlike traditional Web3 data APIs, ChainStream was designed from day one for AI Agents and automation scenarios, providing:

- **Unified Data Layer**: One API to access multi-chain data, no need to integrate multiple vendors
- **Built-in Compliance**: Native KYT/KYA integration, no third-party risk control services needed
- **AI Execution Layer**: Let AI Agents directly operate in the on-chain world through MCP protocol

<Tip>
Enable developers and AI Agents to safely and efficiently access and operate in the on-chain world.

## Core Capabilities

ChainStream provides three core capabilities, covering the complete chain of Web3 data acquisition, security compliance, and AI execution:

### Data — Real-time On-chain Data

Access multi-chain real-time data through a unified API, supporting WebSocket real-time push and historical data queries.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-chain Data Aggregation">
    One API endpoint to access data from Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Polygon, and 10+ mainstream public chains without connecting to multiple data sources separately. Supports cross-chain queries and data standardization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Price & Trading Data">
    Millisecond-level price updates, supporting DEX/CEX aggregated prices, trading pair depth, and candlestick data. WebSocket real-time push with &lt;2ms latency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Smart Money Wallet Tracking">
    Track on-chain smart money movements, including whale wallets, institutional addresses, and KOL wallets. Provides wallet labels, position changes, and trading behavior analysis.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Historical Data Queries">
    Supports historical data queries for any time range, including historical prices, positions, and transaction records. Data retention period varies by plan.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Security — Security & Compliance

Built-in enterprise-grade security compliance capabilities to meet the risk control needs of exchanges, wallets, and DeFi protocols.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="KYT (Know Your Transaction) Transaction Risk Assessment">
    Real-time transaction risk level analysis, identifying suspicious fund flows. Supports OFAC sanctions list checks, mixer identification, and darknet association detection. Returns risk scores (0-100) and detailed risk labels.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="KYA (Know Your Address) Address Profiling">
    Comprehensive address profiling analysis, including address type identification (EOA/contract/multisig), historical behavior analysis, fund source tracing, and associated address mapping.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compliance Audit Support">
    Complete audit logs to meet regulatory reporting requirements. Supports exporting FATF Travel Rule format reports, integrates with mainstream compliance tools (Chainalysis, Elliptic format compatible).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AI Execution — AI Execution Layer

Let AI Agents safely interact with blockchain through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP Server Support">
    Native support for Anthropic MCP protocol, allowing Claude and other AI models to directly call ChainStream capabilities. No adapter code needed, works out of the box.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Agent Friendly Toolset">
    Tool interfaces designed specifically for AI Agents, including structured output, error self-healing, and context preservation. Supports mainstream frameworks like LangChain, AutoGPT, and CrewAI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Natural Language to On-chain Operations">
    AI can complete on-chain queries and operations through natural language commands, such as "Query transactions for address 0x... in the last 7 days" or "Alert me when PEPE price exceeds $0.00001".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
**Security Note**: The AI execution layer only supports read operations and pre-authorized write operations. All sensitive operations require user confirmation.
</Warning>

## Architecture

ChainStream adopts a three-layer architecture design, with each layer providing independent yet complementary capabilities:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', gap: '0', fontFamily: 'system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif' }}>
  <div style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #9333EA 0%, #7C3AED 100%)', color: 'white', padding: '24px 32px', borderRadius: '12px 12px 0 0', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '13px', fontWeight: '600', letterSpacing: '1px', opacity: '0.9', marginBottom: '8px' }}>LAYER 3</div>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: '700', marginBottom: '6px' }}>AI Execution Layer</div>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '14px', opacity: '0.9' }}>MCP Server · AI Tools · Natural Language API</div>
  </div>
  <div style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #F97316 0%, #FB923C 100%)', color: 'white', padding: '24px 32px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '13px', fontWeight: '600', letterSpacing: '1px', opacity: '0.9', marginBottom: '8px' }}>LAYER 2</div>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: '700', marginBottom: '6px' }}>Security & Compliance</div>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '14px', opacity: '0.9' }}>KYT · KYA · Audit · Risk Scoring</div>
  </div>
  <div style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #3B82F6 0%, #60A5FA 100%)', color: 'white', padding: '24px 32px', borderRadius: '0 0 12px 12px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '13px', fontWeight: '600', letterSpacing: '1px', opacity: '0.9', marginBottom: '8px' }}>LAYER 1</div>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: '700', marginBottom: '6px' }}>Data Layer</div>
    <div style={{ fontSize: '14px', opacity: '0.9' }}>Multi-chain Data · Real-time Stream · Smart Money</div>
  </div>
</div>

<Note>
Each layer can be used independently or combined. For example, you can use only the Data layer to get price data, or combine Data + Security to implement deposit detection with risk control.
