<Info>
ChainStream's On-Chain Data API is your gateway to actionable token, pool, contract, and address data across major networks. Whether you're building a DEX, wallet, risk engine, or analytics platform, this API gives you the foundational layer needed to power intelligent decisions and in-app insights.

## Why Use ChainStream On-Chain Data?

Blockchain data is powerful, but it's messy. Developers are often left parsing raw logs or writing custom indexers just to answer simple questionsâ€”What is this token's price? Is this address suspicious? Does this pool have liquidity?

ChainStream solves this with a clean, query-ready interface to the core objects that define on-chain behavior. You get structured data, optimized for performance and clarity, without needing to decode contracts or chase chain-specific formats.
