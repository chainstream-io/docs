High-performance blockchain networks with rapid block production mechanisms have opened up entirely new possibilities for real-time blockchain applications, particularly excelling in trading, payments, and gaming sectors.

Today's decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem processes hundreds of billions of dollars in daily trading volume across multiple blockchain networks. Leading decentralized exchanges like Uniswap V3 frequently surpass $1 billion in daily trading volume, while the total value locked (TVL) in the entire DeFi ecosystem has reached hundreds of billions of dollars.

Blockchain technology is driving the development of fast, scalable on-chain trading systems. In the near future, this technology's applications will extend beyond cryptocurrencies—it will enable on-chain trading of stocks, bonds, forex, commodities, and various other assets.

Building such trading systems requires advanced infrastructure comparable to global top-tier exchanges like NASDAQ, where low latency is a non-negotiable core requirement.

To succeed, developers must be able to reliably access real-time, low-latency on-chain data.

This article will explore in depth the main technical approaches for obtaining ultra-low latency data to support large-scale applications. Our focus is on blockchain data reading; transaction execution-related content will be detailed in subsequent articles.

Considering that blockchain validation nodes are distributed globally rather than centrally deployed, efficiently delivering real-time information faces significant challenges. Optimizing network architecture to achieve fast transmission of blockchain data is crucial for numerous applications.

Let's analyze the various technical solutions for obtaining real-time blockchain data one by one.

## Traditional Approach: Self-Built Node Infrastructure

Currently, most blockchain applications still use traditional data acquisition methods:

**Self-Operated Nodes**: Development teams need to maintain dedicated blockchain nodes for applications that require direct access to on-chain events:
- Account_updates: Account state update events
- Block_notifications: New block notifications
- Transaction_events: Transaction processing events
- State_changes: Metadata for state changes

Some projects also integrate custom plugins to subscribe to data updates, obtain block hashes, slot numbers, and other information.

### What Technical Challenges Exist?

Although this approach is comprehensive, self-built nodes mean independently operating blockchain nodes or validators. This involves continuous infrastructure operations, manual capacity scaling, node security protection, and raw data parsing—tasks that are burdensome even for technically strong teams.

Data filtering capabilities are relatively basic, potentially requiring processing far more data than actually needed, thereby increasing operational costs and system complexity.

In technical communities like Stack Exchange, developers frequently ask about custom data filtering, fully demonstrating the inadequacy of traditional approaches in data processing flexibility.

## ChainStream: Modern Data Solution

ChainStream provides an efficient real-time data streaming system through two convenient interfaces: WebSocket subscription service and Kafka message streams.

**Zero Infrastructure Burden**: No need to operate blockchain nodes independently. Use ChainStream endpoints directly—eliminating server costs, environment configuration, and system upgrade concerns.

**Precise Data Filtering**: Utilize GraphQL's powerful expression filters to precisely obtain needed data (filterable by address, token type, smart contract, transaction amount, etc.). Say goodbye to processing irrelevant data.

**Structured Data Output**: All data is pre-structured, labeled, and enriched (including USD values for tokens/transactions). Focus on feature development, not raw data parsing.

**Comprehensive DEX Support**: Instantly access trading data from mainstream DEXes, covering 50+ blockchain networks without additional data parsing work.

**Historical and Real-time Integration**: Query historical data and real-time event streams through unified API interfaces.

**Professional Operations Assurance**: ChainStream handles system stability, data redundancy, and failover—keeping you away from midnight operations alerts.

**Rapid Deployment**: Start using within minutes, not weeks of preparation time.

## ChainStream WebSocket Data Streams (Powerful Filtering Capabilities)

ChainStream's WebSocket subscription service provides real-time data access with latency under 2 seconds. Query functionality is rich and supports fine filtering, allowing you to precisely obtain needed data streams down to address, smart contract, or transaction amount levels.

## Technical Solution Comparison Analysis

**Core Technical Differences**

Geyser solutions provide entry notification streams for real-time tracking of ledger entry changes.

ChainStream directly processes unconfirmed transactions and typically doesn't provide separate entry notification stream functionality.

Since ChainStream focuses on unconfirmed transaction processing, they can provide block data before final block confirmation, with response speeds typically superior to other technical solutions.

ChainStream's distinctive features include: real-time instruction and log parsing, and instruction-level balance updates (showing balance changes caused by each instruction). Even Geyser cannot natively provide instruction-level balance update functionality.

## ChainStream Subscription Service and Kafka Core Value

**Ultra-Low Latency and Real-Time Data Processing**
ChainStream's Kafka streams can achieve sub-100 millisecond latency, crucial for high-frequency trading scenarios processing hundreds of billions of dollars in daily trading volume. Accessing unconfirmed transaction data provides early market signals before final block confirmation.

**Enterprise-Grade Scaling Capability**
ChainStream's Kafka-based distributed architecture can handle massive data throughput, equipped with built-in data replication and automatic failover mechanisms. Can seamlessly scale from thousands of transactions per second to millions of transactions processing capability without additional infrastructure management work.

**Development Efficiency Enhancement**
ChainStream provides pre-processed, enriched data including USD prices and protocol identification information, significantly reducing complex data parsing workload. Zero node operations means trading systems and DeFi applications can reach market faster.
