## Why Chainstream Real-Time Market Data

Most market data APIs are either delayed, incomplete, or locked to a single blockchain. Chainstream solves this by delivering high-frequency data across every major on-chain asset—streamed directly from source-level infrastructure. No custom indexing, no third-party aggregators, just reliable, raw data with sub-second updates.
