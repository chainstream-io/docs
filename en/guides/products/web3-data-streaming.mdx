## Why Use Web3 Data Streaming?

Traditional APIs require constant polling and often miss short-lived events. With Chainstream, you get push-based access to real-time blockchain activity as it happens. Whether you're building DeFi monitoring tools, automated trading bots, or alerting systems, streaming data provides the foundation for high-performance, event-driven infrastructure.
