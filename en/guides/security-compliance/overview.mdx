## ChainStream Compliance Capabilities

### KYT (Know Your Transaction)

Risk assessment for **individual transactions**:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    tx[Transaction] --> register[Register Transfer]
    register --> analyze[Risk Analysis]
    analyze --> source[Source Tracing]
    analyze --> dest[Destination Analysis]
    analyze --> entity[Entity Identification]
    source --> score[Risk Scoring]
    dest --> score
    entity --> score
    score --> result[Query Results]
```

**Core Features**:
- Transaction risk scoring
- Fund source/destination tracing
- Entity identification
- Alert generation

See [KYT Concepts](/en/guides/data-concepts/kyt-concepts) for details.

### KYA (Know Your Address)

Risk assessment for **wallet addresses**:

- Address risk rating
- Historical behavior analysis
- Entity identification
- Label classification

See [KYA Concepts](/en/guides/data-concepts/kya-concepts) for details.

## Integration

KYT/KYA uses a **Register + Query** two-step model: first register a transaction or address, then query the assessment results after the system completes risk analysis.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Transaction Risk (KYT)">
    **Step 1: Register Transfer**
    
    ```bash
    POST /v1/kyt/transfer
    {
      "network": "ethereum",
      "asset": "ETH",
      "transferReference": "your-unique-reference",
      "direction": "received",
      "transferTimestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "txHash": "0x...",
      "outputAddress": "0x..."
    }
    ```
    
    **Step 2: Query Results**
    
    ```bash
    # Get risk summary
    GET /v1/kyt/transfers/{transferId}/summary
    
    # Get risk alerts
    GET /v1/kyt/transfers/{transferId}/alerts
    
    # Get direct risk exposure
    GET /v1/kyt/transfers/{transferId}/exposures/direct
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Address Risk (KYA)">
    **Step 1: Register Address**
    
    ```bash
    POST /v1/kyt/address
    {
      "network": "ethereum",
      "address": "0x...",
      "asset": "ETH"
    }
    ```
    
    **Step 2: Query Risk Rating**
    
    ```bash
    GET /v1/kyt/addresses/{address}/risk
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Integration Example">
    Integrate KYT into your deposit flow:
    
    ```javascript
    import { ChainStreamClient } from '@chainstream-io/sdk';
    
    const client = new ChainStreamClient(process.env.CHAINSTREAM_ACCESS_TOKEN);
    
    async function processDeposit(txHash, toAddress) {
      // Step 1: Register transfer
      const transfer = await client.kyt.registerTransfer({
        network: 'ethereum',
        asset: 'ETH',
        transferReference: `deposit-${txHash}`,
        direction: 'received',
        transferTimestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        txHash: txHash,
        outputAddress: toAddress
      });
      
      // Step 2: Query risk summary
      const summary = await client.kyt.getTransferSummary(transfer.transferId);
      
      // Step 3: Make decision based on risk level
      if (summary.rating === 'highRisk' || summary.rating === 'severe') {
        // Get detailed alerts
        const alerts = await client.kyt.getTransferAlerts(transfer.transferId);
        await flagForReview(txHash, alerts);
        return { status: 'pending_review', alerts };
      }
      
      return { status: 'approved', rating: summary.rating };
    }
