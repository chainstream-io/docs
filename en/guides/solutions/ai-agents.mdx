title: 'AI Agents'
description: 'Build smarter agents with real-time on-chain intelligence'
---

<Info>
Web3 agents are evolving—from simple bots that execute trades to intelligent assistants that observe wallet behavior, flag risks, and even manage portfolios. What powers this evolution isn't just AI models. It's the data they operate on.
</Info>

ChainStream provides the real-time data backbone needed to build truly intelligent agents. Whether you're developing autonomous trading systems, AI-powered wallet advisors, or protocol risk sentinels, ChainStream gives your agents access to the raw on-chain truth—structured, labeled, and delivered in milliseconds.

**This means your agents don't just see more. They understand more. And they react faster.**

## For AI that acts, reacts, and explains

Agent-based architectures in Web3 fall into three broad categories—each with distinct data needs:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Action-Oriented Agents" icon="robot-astromech" color="#4D9CFF">
    <div>
      These agents perform operations on behalf of users or protocols—trading, rebalancing, minting, or moving assets. For them, latency is everything. They must act based on what just happened, not what happened 5 seconds ago.
    </div>
    <div className="mt-2">
      ChainStream delivers real-time event streams across tokens, contracts, and chains, so these agents always operate on the most current state.
    </div>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Insight-Oriented Agents" icon="brain" color="#16A34A">
    <div>
      These agents interpret on-chain behavior—classifying wallets, tagging transactions, or evaluating portfolio risks. They rely on clean, multi-layered data that reflects both real-time changes and historical context.
    </div>
    <div className="mt-2">
      ChainStream gives these agents access to enriched event data, wallet-level asset snapshots, and deep query capabilities via GraphQL—so their "understanding" is both fast and deep.
    </div>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Defense-Oriented Agents" icon="shield-halved" color="#FB6514">
    <div>
      These agents monitor for attacks, exploits, MEV patterns, or risky contract behavior. Their job is to watch everything, all the time, and raise flags the instant something breaks.
    </div>
    <div className="mt-2">
      ChainStream's Kafka-powered infrastructure supports this scale—millions of messages per second, deduplicated and normalized—so your defense logic doesn't miss the signal in the noise.
    </div>

## How ChainStream powers agents

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sub-100ms event streams" icon="bolt">
    Our Web3 Data Streaming Service delivers real-time token movements, contract calls, swaps, and staking actions across 25+ blockchains. Kafka-based delivery ensures stable throughput under high load—ideal for latency-sensitive use cases.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Asset and wallet understanding" icon="wallet">
    Use our Account & Asset API to instantly retrieve a wallet's complete state—token balances, NFTs, LP positions, staking rewards, and more. Build agents that track user positions, not just transactions.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Enriched event context" icon="tag">
    Every streamed event is tagged with metadata: protocol name, token info, actor type, and behavioral tags (e.g. MEV bot, CEX, exploiter). Agents can reason over these tags without building their own classifiers.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Custom reasoning via GraphQL" icon="brackets-curly">
    For agents that need to correlate behavior, compute trends, or explain what changed, our GraphQL Query Engine offers dynamic querying of structured blockchain data across chains.
  </Card>

## What you can build

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Autonomous trading agents" icon="chart-line">
    Build bots that monitor price shifts, liquidity changes, or arbitrage routes in real time—and execute based on current market state.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Wallet assistants" icon="user-astronaut">
    Agents that summarize new asset changes, estimate net worth, or suggest token actions based on on-chain context.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Security sentinels" icon="shield-check">
    Detect wallet drains, rug pulls, or risky approvals as they happen, and alert users or revoke access autonomously.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Protocol health checkers" icon="stethoscope">
    Observe protocol TVL, reward issuance, or user behavior in real time. Flag anomalous patterns or changes in usage.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="AI copilots for explorers" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Agents that sit on top of your interface and answer: "What just happened to this token?", "Who are the top buyers?", or "Was this transfer risky?"
  </Card>
