description: 'Build real-time insights into blockchain behavior with high-frequency event streaming'
---

<Info>
Today's Web3 applications don't just read data—they react to it. Whether you're tracking whale transfers, detecting MEV activity, or flagging protocol risk in real time, your system depends on the ability to analyze events as they happen—and act on them immediately.
</Info>

ChainStream gives you the data infrastructure to build these systems with confidence. Our Kafka-based streaming architecture captures high-frequency blockchain events, across chains, with the speed and structure needed for both instant alerts and deeper analytics.

**No lag. No noise. Just actionable data when and where it matters.**

## What You Can Build

With ChainStream, you can go far beyond displaying token charts or historical stats. You can build products that:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Smart contract triggers" icon="bolt">
    Trigger smart contract actions the moment a threshold is breached—like auto-liquidations, rate resets, or pausing a vault
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="User notifications" icon="bell">
    Send user alerts for events like wallet drains, NFT sales, or large inflows to a protocol
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Behavior monitoring" icon="user-secret">
    Monitor address behavior to detect airdrop farming, MEV bots, or signs of potential exploits
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-time classification" icon="tags">
    Classify transactions in real time, with tags for category (swap, bridge, stake), actor (CEX, whale, smart contract), or risk level
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Live dashboards" icon="chart-simple">
    Generate real-time analytics for dashboards tracking TVL shifts, protocol-specific flows, or wallet activity clusters
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These systems rely on fast and structured data. ChainStream delivers both.

## Why ChainStream

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Kafka at the core" icon="server" color="#4D9CFF">
    Our infrastructure is built on a high-throughput Kafka architecture, supporting millions of events per second with sub-100ms delivery. Perfect for streaming large-scale transaction activity to your alert engine or analytics layer.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Full-spectrum events" icon="wave-square" color="#16A34A">
    Subscribe to token transfers, swaps, contract calls, NFT interactions, staking events, or liquidity movements—across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and more.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-time enrichment" icon="tag" color="#FB6514">
    Events come structured and labeled. Every transfer is paired with metadata like token symbol, protocol name, sender/receiver tags, and transaction context—so you don't have to guess what happened.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cross-chain normalization" icon="link" color="#9333EA">
    All events follow a unified schema. You can write one logic pipeline that works across chains, with no need to handle inconsistent formats.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Card title="Queryable context" icon="database">
  Use the GraphQL engine or On-Chain API to enrich stream events with surrounding data: historical balance changes, contract metadata, protocol stats, and more.
</Card>

## Key APIs to Build With

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Web3 Data Streaming Service" icon="satellite-dish" defaultOpen>
    Your source of structured on-chain events—delivered over Kafka, WebSocket, or your preferred sink. Includes token transfers, swaps, NFT activity, contract calls, and custom filters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On-Chain Data API" icon="database">
    Enrich alerts with token metadata, address classifications, contract intelligence, and pool stats.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account & Asset API" icon="wallet">
    When an alert fires, instantly fetch what that wallet owns—tokens, NFTs, positions—without writing multi-chain queries.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="GraphQL Query Engine" icon="brackets-curly">
    Create custom analytics queries: e.g. top inflow addresses this hour, whale swap routes by size, or recent activity spikes by protocol.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Used For
