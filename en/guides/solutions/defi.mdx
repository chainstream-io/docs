<Info>
Building DeFi products is more than just deploying smart contracts. Developers need fast and reliable data to track protocol events, monitor asset flows, and trigger time-sensitive actions. Whether you're building a lending protocol, a staking app, or a derivatives platform, access to real-time on-chain data is critical to user safety, contract logic, and UX quality.

## What DeFi Builders Need

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Real-time monitoring" icon="chart-line">
    Monitoring wallet and pool activity in real time
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Low-latency tracking" icon="bolt">
    Tracking token inflows/outflows at millisecond latency
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Asset visibility" icon="eye">
    Getting up-to-date views of user assets, staked positions, and rewards
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Event detection" icon="bell">
    Detecting on-chain triggers like liquidations, vault breaches, or oracle updates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How ChainStream Helps

ChainStream delivers the low-latency data layer DeFi protocols need to operate with confidence—even under network stress or market spikes.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Real-time event push" icon="satellite-dish" color="#4D9CFF">
    No more polling for state changes. Use event streams to react to deposits, swaps, claims, and oracle updates as they happen.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Account-level asset snapshots" icon="wallet" color="#16A34A">
    Know exactly what a wallet holds—across chains, tokens, pools, and protocols—in a single API call.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Kafka-powered performance" icon="gauge-high" color="#FB6514">
    Handle large event volumes with consistent throughput and low lag, even during volatile periods.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="GraphQL for smart queries" icon="brackets-curly" color="#9333EA">
    Ask complex questions about pool status, address history, or token composition without chaining requests.

## Core APIs for DeFi

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Web3 Data Streaming Service" icon="satellite-dish" defaultOpen>
    Subscribe to high-frequency blockchain events (deposits, liquidations, swaps, etc.) via Kafka, WebSocket, or your preferred pipeline.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Account & Asset API" icon="wallet">
    Query real-time asset holdings across 25+ chains, including token balances, DeFi positions, and staking rewards.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="On-Chain Data API" icon="database">
    Retrieve normalized pool data, smart contract event logs, and address-level intelligence to support protocol operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="GraphQL Query Engine" icon="brackets-curly">
    Build precise, high-efficiency queries across chains for vault stats, user risk exposure, and liquidity tracking.
  </Accordion>

## Typical Scenarios

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Lending & Borrowing Protocols" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Monitor vault health, trigger liquidations, and update interest rates based on live market and user behavior data.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Staking & Yield Apps" icon="piggy-bank">
    Show real-time APY calculations, track staked token flows, and notify users of claimable rewards or pool changes.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Derivatives Platforms" icon="chart-line">
    React to market movement and user margin changes instantly. Use real-time balance and oracle data to protect traders from slippage or under-collateralization.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Risk Engines" icon="shield-halved">
    Flag suspicious activity, detect abnormal TVL shifts, and throttle interactions when asset volatility spikes.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Reward Automation" icon="gift">
    Automatically distribute rewards, trigger incentive resets, or rebalance pools based on real-time user actions and protocol metrics.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
