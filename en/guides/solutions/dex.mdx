## Why It Matters

Most market data feeds on Web3 are either too slow, too limited, or too fragmented. Traditional approaches require polling multiple APIs, indexing data manually, or relying on third-party aggregators that introduce lag and inaccuracies.

With ChainStream, your DEX operates on a direct stream of on-chain activity, powered by our Kafka-based infrastructure. This means:
