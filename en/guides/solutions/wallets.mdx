description: 'Build modern crypto wallets with comprehensive asset tracking and real-time updates'

<Info>
Modern crypto wallets are no longer just key signers—they're real-time asset dashboards. Users expect to see their balances, NFTs, and protocol positions across multiple chains, all at once, and all up to date. Anything slower than real time, or less than complete, breaks trust and drives users away.

## What Wallet Builders Care About

Building a modern wallet requires more than just querying balances. You need:

  <Card title="Complete asset picture" icon="chart-pie">
    A complete picture of all wallet assets (tokens, NFTs, LPs, staked positions)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cross-chain coverage" icon="link">
    Cross-chain coverage with consistent formats
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-time updates" icon="bolt">
    Real-time updates without polling
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Smooth experience" icon="mobile-screen">
    Fast and stable UX across mobile and web
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Simple integration" icon="plug">
    Simple integration and low backend maintenance
  </Card>

## How ChainStream Helps

ChainStream removes the pain of managing blockchain integrations and building custom data pipelines. You can power a full wallet interface—tokens, NFTs, DeFi—all from a single API call, updated in real time.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Unified asset view" icon="wallet" color="#4D9CFF">
    Show full token, NFT, and DeFi holdings for any address, across 25+ chains, with a single query.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Real-time sync" icon="rotate" color="#16A34A">
    Push-based architecture means your UI updates the moment balances or ownership change.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Event-level granularity" icon="magnifying-glass-chart" color="#FB6514">
    Go beyond "balance" and track how and why it changed—detect transfers, new deposits, protocol interactions, or unusual behavior.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="No indexing required" icon="database" color="#9333EA">
    Everything is pre-normalized and query-ready. No need to decode logs, track tokens manually, or parse NFT metadata yourself.
  </Card>

<Card title="Built for wallets, not explorers" icon="compass">
  Our asset engine is optimized for consumer wallets—not block explorers. That means better formatting, faster loading, and structured filters that fit into your product's UI.

## APIs to Build With

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account & Asset API" icon="wallet" defaultOpen>
    Core to wallet views. Retrieve full holdings across chains: token balances, NFT ownership, DeFi positions, protocol metadata.
